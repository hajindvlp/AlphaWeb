The Alpha Foundation has been investigating and writing reports on
"Alpha Concepts" (AC) since its foundation.
"Alpha Concept" refers to supernatural phenomena,
people, objects, or concepts found in the world.
The founder, Alpha, is currently under arbitrary management
by the foundation, with the serial code AC-Alpha.
The founder of the Alpha Foundation is a Korean 
who went abroad to study and found out about the existence of the SCP Foundation, 
and then returned to Korea to set up a foundation to investigate other 
supernatural concepts, including himself, who was inherently unusual.
