The following are detailed information on the essential elements to be 
included in the title and content of the document.

Serial code:
Serial codes are usually numbered, added 1 to the last AC number, and 
numbered in four digits. If the number is less than four digits, write 
0 in the blank space to help you access the data.
In special cases, ACs that are related to any organ, or that are self-made 
by the Foundation, will be given another number, including the basic number 
of the serial code.
Example) => Alpha Foundation Self-produced AC = AC-0025-Alpha-0001_Example.txt
The designated agencies will continue to be updated and all other agency codes 
will be ineffective.
Specified Agency Code
Korea Digital Media High School => DIMI
Alpha Foundation Self-Build => ALPHA

Title:
Titles should be given names that are easy to understand and as short as possible
 to remember and call AC. Also, if spacing is used, space is replaced with _.

Rating:
The ratings represent the risk of AC, which uses A, B, C, D, E and F. If Alpha is
determined to be deployed, A and Alphaforce units should be deployed, B and 
Alfred units should be deployed, and C and Alphys units should be deployed. 
If D and Alans are deployed and are sufficiently manageable, E,
if they feel completely safe and need not be isolated at all, F is given.
